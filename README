The documentation on the TUXEDO perl module can be viewed 
by running perdoc TUXEDO.pm.

To build this, do the following

1/ Edit Makefile.pl.  Change the hardcoded tuxedo paths in LIBS and INC to
   the correct location of tuxedo on your system.

2/ perl Makefile.pl

3/ make test
   This is the first release of this module so not everything is automated
   as well as I would like.  To get the test to work successfully, you 
   need to have these environment variables set up...
	TUXCONFIG=<the config of a tuxedo sytem>
	FLDTBLDIR32=$TUXDIR/udataobj
	FIELDTBLS32=tpadm
	The test will attempt to connect to the tuxedo system specified by
   TUXCONFIG, perform a .TMIB service call and disconnect.

4/ make install

REMEMBER, this is the very first release of this module so if you have
problems, try to fix it yourself and e-mail me with the modifications.
