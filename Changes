Revision history for Perl extension TUXEDO.

0.01  Thu Dec  2 11:59:49 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

2.05 - changed calloc to malloc + memset because calloc caused perl crash on windows when freeing memory during global destruction.
     - Now builds and runs on WIN32

2.06 - changed module and package name from 'TUXEDO' to 'Tuxedo' to follow cpan standards. 

2.07 - now support perl sub tuxedo services.  Probably broke the WIN32 build.
